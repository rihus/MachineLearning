SimpleLinReg_single.py file contain the simple linear regression model fit on single fuel consumption dataset (FuelConsumption.csv) at a time...

SimpleLinReg_multi.py file contain the simple linear regression model fit on multiple fuel consumption datasets (FuelConsumption.csv) simultaneously. Multiple linear regression is an extension of the simple linear regression on single datasets

NonLinReg.py has an example of non linear regression model fit, as done on China's GDP data.
